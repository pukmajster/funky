# Funky

Funky is an open-source mods manager for Left 4 Dead 2, developed with Electron, Dexie, Svelte and Skeleton UI.

Initially inspired by Left 4 Dead 2's terrible in-game addons menu, I wanted something that gives me more functionality, like search and a better method of solving conflicts, but the scope has since gotten much broader with lots of other great features and improvements that are lacking in the in-game menu.

Please note that Funky is still in beta / early development. Future updates may or may not introduce breaking changes that may or may not break user configurations.

## Installation

You can find the latest releases of Funky for Windows and Linux on the [Releases page](https://github.com/pukmajster/funky/releases).

Note that Windows will warn you about installing an unknown app as I'm not ready to give Microsoft my money yet.

## Caveats

While I've found Funky to be extremly useful in organizing my ever growing library of mods, there's some things to keep in mind:

- The game needs to be restarted before any changes made in Funky can take effect.
- Newly subscribed-to Workshop mods will only be downloaded after you start the game.

So taking both of these points into account, if you've just subscribed to a new mod, you'll have to open up the game, wait for the game to download the mod, close the game, make any changes in Funky and then finally, run the game from within Funky in order for all changes to take effect. Quite clumbersome, but it is what it is.
